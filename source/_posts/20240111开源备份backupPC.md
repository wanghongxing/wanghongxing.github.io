# Install the following requisites for BackupPC version 4.3.1



```

yum -y install bzip2 httpd mod_perl par2cmdline perl-Archive-Zip perl-CGI \
perl-Compress-Raw-Zlib perl-Data-Dumper perl-Digest-MD5 perl-File-Listing \
perl-File-RsyncP perl-Net-FTP-AutoReconnect perl-Net-FTP-RetrHandle \
perl-Time-ParseDate perl-XML-RSS perl-version rrdtool samba-client
```

# Lets set up some directories that we are going to use later.

My backuppc server has a raid10 array mounted at /data/. I am going to use this to store the data for backuppc. Lets create the backuppc folder on my raid. Note: this folder can grow to be extremely large.

```
mkdir -p /data/backuppc
```



Now lets create one more folder for BackupPC to store some web interface files.

```
mkdir -p /var/www/html/backuppc
```



And create the cgi-bin directory for backuppc

```
mkdir -p /var/www/cgi-bin/backuppc
```



Make note of those 2 directories. The installer will ask for them if we don't explicitly set them below.

# Create and setup the backuppc user.

Create group backuppc.

```
groupadd backuppc
```



Create backuppc user, and tell it where its home folder is. My backuppc user's home folder is /opt/backuppc. Change this to whatever you'd like.

```
useradd --home-dir /opt/backuppc --create-home --shell /bin/bash --base-dir /opt/backuppc --gid backuppc backuppc


```

# Set Permissions on the directories we created:

```
chown -R backuppc:backuppc /data/backuppc
chown -R backuppc:backuppc /opt/backuppc
```

# Download the BackupPC tar.gz archive and extract it.

```
cd ~
wget https://github.com/backuppc/backuppc/releases/download/4.4.0/BackupPC-4.4.0.tar.gz
tar zxf BackupPC-4.4.0.tar.gz
cd BackupPC-4.4.0

```

# Run the configure.pl script

Pay close attention to the paths in this command.

```
perl configure.pl --batch --cgi-dir /var/www/cgi-bin/backuppc \
--data-dir /data0/backuppc --hostname backuppc --html-dir /var/www/html/backuppc \
--html-dir-url /backuppc --install-dir /opt/backuppc
```



Alternatively, you can execute the perl script with no arguments and it will walk you through the install step by step. This is the preferred method if you are upgrading a version 3.X install. (Not supported by this guide)

```
perl configure.pl
```



```
Ok, we're about to:

  - install the binaries, lib and docs in /usr/local/BackupPC
  - create the data directory /data/BackupPC
  - optionally install the cgi-bin interface
  - create/update the config.pl file /etc/BackupPC/config.pl
--> Do you want to continue? [y]?

Installing docs in /usr/local/BackupPC/share/doc/BackupPC
Installing cgi script BackupPC_Admin in /var/www/cgi-bin/backuppc
Installing config.pl and hosts in /etc/BackupPC

Ok, it looks like we are finished.  There are several more things you
will need to do:

  - Browse through the config file, /etc/BackupPC/config.pl,
    and make sure all the settings are correct.  In particular,
    you will need to set $Conf{CgiAdminUsers} so you have
    administration privileges in the CGI interface.

  - Edit the list of hosts to backup in /etc/BackupPC/hosts.

  - Read the documentation in /usr/local/BackupPC/doc/BackupPC.html.
    Please pay special attention to the security section.

  - Verify that the CGI script BackupPC_Admin runs correctly.  You might
    need to change the permissions or group ownership of BackupPC_Admin.
    If this is an upgrade and you are using mod_perl, you will need
    to restart Apache.  Otherwise it will have stale code.

  - BackupPC should be ready to start.  Don't forget to run it
    as user backuppc!  The installation also contains
    a systemd/backuppc.service script that can be installed so
    that BackupPC can auto-start on boot.  This will also enable
    administrative users to start the server from the CGI interface.
    See systemd/README.

Enjoy!

# Apache config

I chose the CGI route (not S-CGI) and chose the directory /var/www/cgi-bin/backuppc for my CGI directory. I chose /var/www/html/backuppc as my images directory. You may need to set this path in the config if you ran the configure.pl script with no arguments.

Now we need to copy the Apache config into the apache conf.d directory.

```
cp httpd/BackupPC.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/
```

# Install the included systemd script:

```
cp systemd/backuppc.service /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start backuppc
systemctl enable backuppc
```

# Create the backuppc authentication file.

```
htpasswd -c /etc/BackupPC/BackupPC.users backuppc

zaq1XSW2
```



Note: this sets the username to backuppc (modify it to your liking)

Set permissions on this file.

```
chown backuppc:backuppc /etc/BackupPC/BackupPC.users
```

# Edit the config.pl file in /etc/BackupPC/

```
vim /etc/BackupPC/config.pl
```



Check the image directory and image url variables.

```
$Conf{CgiImageDir} = '/var/www/html/backuppc';
$Conf{CgiImageDirURL} = '/BackupPc';
```



Also add backuppc as the administrative user: `$Conf{CgiAdminUsers}     = 'backuppc';`

这时候不能往/etc/BackupPC目录写东西，

chcon -R -t httpd_sys_content_t /etc/BackupPC
